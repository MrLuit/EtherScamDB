# Ethereum Scam Database

*An open-source database to keep track of all the current ethereum scams*

## Usage

Make sure you have both [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

Then, open a command line anywhere and run the following commands:

> git clone https://github.com/MrLuit/EtherScamDB.git

> npm install

> node run.js

The command line should now exit, asking you to update the config.js file with correct values. Please use your own API keys. When you're done, launch run.js again:

> node run.js

Generating should take a couple of minutes the first time or after a clean, but when `cache.json` is already present it should launch instantly.

## Flags

- `--clean` Clean up all the old files and folders
- `--update` Manually update all content

## Contribute
